# OpenTelemetry code samples

These are demo projects based on the OpenTelemetry example code.
The idea is to provide accessible playgrounds which also explore features beyond the basic tutorials.
These are meant to be functional with a Grafana Cloud account.

## Maturity Levels
### Manual instrumentation
- Level m0: the base code provided by OpenTelemetry
- Level m1: craps function
- Level m2: shoddy dice roll function, error handling
- Level m3: sampling
