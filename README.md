# OpenTelemetry code samples

These are demo projects based on the OpenTelemetry example code.
The idea is to provide accessible playgrounds which also explore features beyond the basic tutorials.
These are meant to be functional with a Grafana Cloud account.

## Maturity Levels
### Manual instrumentation
- Level m0: [initial roll dice](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/getting-started/#create-and-launch-an-http-server)
- Level m1: [instrumented roll dice code from getting started](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/getting-started/#add-opentelemetry-instrumentation)
- Level m2: craps function- demonstrate passing HTTP [`traceparent` header](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#traceparent-header)
- Level m3: roll dice over protocol buffer
- Level m4: shoddy dice roll function, error handling
- Level m5: sampling
