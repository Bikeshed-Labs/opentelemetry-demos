# OpenTelemetry code samples

These are demo projects based on the OpenTelemetry example code.
The idea is to provide accessible playgrounds which also explore features beyond the basic tutorials.
These are meant to be functional with a Grafana Cloud account.

## Maturity Levels
- Level 0: the base code provided by OpenTelemetry
- Level 1: craps function
- Level 2: shoddy dice roll function, error handling
- Level 3: sampling
